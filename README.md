# -Wine_Quality_Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the quality of wine based on its chemical characteristics.  
The dataset includes diverse chemical attributes such as density and acidity, which serve as features for multiple classifier models.

##  Key Concepts and Challenges
- **Classifier Models:** Random Forest, SGD, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC).  
- **Chemical Qualities:** Analyze features like density and acidity.  
- **Data Analysis Libraries:** Use Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.  
- **Data Visualization:** Apply Seaborn and Matplotlib for insights.  

##  Learning Objectives
- Learn classification techniques for real‑world datasets.  
- Understand how chemical properties affect wine quality.  
- Gain experience in model comparison and evaluation.  

##  Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit‑learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
